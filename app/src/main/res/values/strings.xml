recommend using gifts even if it is small (eg, a candy or extra TV time). Using a gift acts as a
reward and enables the child to wait for it and build patience. If you choose to proceed
without a gift, the child will receive a virtual trophy inside the app. Trophies collected by kids can be exchanged later for gifts from parents.</string>
